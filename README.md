# WebCam_ImageProcessing

This code is heavily based on code from David Barr, aka javidx9, ï¿½OneLoneCoder 2019

Here's a piece of the introduction comments from the mainfile WebCam_ImageProcessing.cpp

## Why did I do this ?

I have 40+ year of programming, starting from assembler of the 6502 that was used for a product, an IBM third party SNA protocol converter, and for private projects the Zilog Z80A that was inside the Sinclair Spectrum.

I have, through the years, worked professioally with each of the following languages for at least 5 years:

Assembler, Forth, Perl, Unix BSD Shell, Many basic dialects, mostly Visual Basic, Delphi, Javascript, C#, SQL, and more.

Languages I have avoided, mostly on purpose, are Python, PHP, C and C++. I think Python and PHP are terrible in syntax, but it is quite impressive what can be made with phyton, but this still dont make Python attractive to me.

But C++ I need now. It is a language I am getting the grips on during the last few years. I create hardware and firmware for various, PLC kind of, projects, based on At-Mega MCU's. So I need to learn more quirks of C++ to make my work better.

Therefore, I searched Youtube for educational C++ videos, and I found mostly uninteresting videos like "learn C++ in a few hours" and such, mostly crap with no appeal whatsoever.

But I also found jarvidX9 aka David Barr, and caught interest immediately because of the hands-on and the nice presentation. Please, keep them coming David.

I immediately subscribed and watched quite a few of the videos from him. But the 8 bit of image processing video was the one that really caught my interest.

I downloaded the fantastic work by David Barr, and used my weekend to rewrite some parts and add a kind of plugin system to make image processors in separate files and pluggable - in development - not in runtime.

I also wanted the image processors to be able to be added after each other during runtime so the system could have one or more image processors after each other, ex. Motion, Threshold and Morphing, therefore each processor must be able pipe their work from one to another somehow. As a processor maybe need other image frames for their own work, these frames must be local to the individual processor.

As all processors needs some common functionallity, I have created a base class to handle all the complexity of registering and interfacing with the master program code.

**A single processor can now:**
* Register itself with typeid and factory method
* Return its name
* Process a image frame
* Write info to UI about self
* Process keyboard input
* Hold private frames for sequential image processing

**As a user, with this code running, you can:**
* Add one processor after another using the ENTER key
* Delete the last added with the DEL key
* The last processor is selectable from all available using the PGUP and PGDN keys
* The last added processors parameters, can be edited with the arrow keys, while viewing the image change

**As a developer you add new image processors by:**
* copy an existing processor file
* Replace the name throughout the file
* Replace the image processing code
* Add the processor with #include at the top of the main cpp file

### Thats it.

_Have fun..._
